# Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

## Continuous Integration
As a development team, we face the consistent challenge of delivering high-quality software quickly and efficiently. To meet these requirements, we have developed a custom CI/CD pipeline based on GitHub Actions. In this blog post, we will proudly share our experience with three GitHub Actions that automate build, unit testing, and dependency checking. We will talk about the benefits we have achieved through this pipeline and how it has improved our work as a development team.
<br />  
<br />  

**The Build Step**  
Our first step in the CI/CD pipeline is the build process. This is where our GitHub actions come into play to compile the code and create an executable version of the application. Thanks to this automation, we can ensure that the code is merged smoothly and that all dependencies are resolved correctly. This saves us valuable time and reduces human error.
<br />  
<br />  

**Unit tests**  
GitHub actions allow us to seamlessly integrate our unit tests into the development process. Once the build is complete, our test cases are automatically executed. This automated test suite helps us identify potential bugs or regressions early on. This gives us confidence in the code weâ€™re developing and helps us ensure that the application works as expected. GitHub Actions make it easy to monitor test results and quickly take countermeasures when needed.
<br />  
<br />  

**Dependency Check**  
Dependency checking has always been an important aspect of our development work. With the help of another GitHub action, we can automatically check whether the libraries and modules we use have security holes or known vulnerabilities. This allows us to minimize potential risks and ensure that our application meets the highest standards in terms of security. The GitHub action for dependency checking has sped up our process and gives us confidence that we are relying on secure resources.

## Continuous Delivery
As developers, we want to ensure that our Java program is easily and efficiently delivered to an executable application package as part of the Continuous Delivery process. Since we are developing a desktop app, we do not have an automated Continuous Delivery (CD) workflow in place. In our case, we use Maven and the Assembly package to perform this process manually. Below we describe the process of how we can achieve this:
<br />  
<br />  

**Maven configuration**  
We make sure that our Maven project is properly configured. This includes adding the required dependencies, plugins, and build settings in the pom.xml file. In particular, we need the assembly plugin to enable packaging of the executable application.
<br />  
<br />  

**Assembly plugin configuration**  
In our pom.xml file, we added the required configuration for the assembly plugin. We defined an assembly descriptor that contains the instructions for building the package. This descriptor specifies which files to include in the package and what the folder structure of the application should look like.
<br />  
<br />  

**Create Assembly Descriptor**  
We created an assembly descriptor in which we defined the desired structure of the application package. This includes specifying the source files to be included in the package, paths, and directory structures. For example, we can specify that the compiled classes, resources, and external dependencies be copied to specific directories within the package.
<br />  
<br />  

**Run Maven build**  
To package the executable application, we run the maven build command. For example, this can be mvn clean package. This compiles the code, runs tests, and applies the specified assembly rules. The resulting application package is created in the target directory.
<br />  
<br />  

After we have successfully packaged our Java application into an executable file, the next challenge is to deliver it to our customers. To do this, customers receive a link to download the latest version of our software when they sign a contract. For deployment, we use a second, private repository to which we synchronize the executable. This way we ensure that our customers can always use the latest version of our software.

By performing this manual process with Maven and the Assembly plugin, we can develop our Java program into an executable application package for Continuous Delivery. It is important to ensure that this step is integrated into the overall CI/CD pipeline process to ensure smooth and automated application deployment.

## Benefits of our CI/CD pipeline
**Faster deployment**  
Automating the development process and integrating testing can speed up software deployment. This allows new features and bug fixes to be delivered to users faster.
<br />  
<br />  

**Higher code quality**  
Continuous integration of code changes and automated testing improves code quality. Potential bugs and issues are identified and fixed early, resulting in more robust and stable code.
<br />  
<br />  

**Reduced risk**  
The CI/CD pipeline minimizes the risk of bugs and issues in the production environment. By automating build and test processes, potential sources of errors can be identified and fixed before the application is deployed to the live environment. This minimizes unexpected failures or disruptions.
<br />  
<br />  

**Better team collaboration**  
A CI/CD pipeline promotes collaboration within the development team. Automating and standardizing processes creates a consistent and transparent work environment. Developers can more easily collaborate, integrate changes, and identify conflicts early.
<br />  
<br />  

**Scalability and flexibility**  
The CI/CD pipeline enables software projects to scale efficiently. By automating the development and deployment processes, new features and applications can be developed and deployed faster. In addition, the flexibility of the pipeline enables adaptation to different environments and requirements.
