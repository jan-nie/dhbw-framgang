## Introduction
This section provides an overview of the software testing process and the scope of the testing activities.

## Test Strategy
/*We have implemented functional and non-functional test types so far. Functional test types include unit tests, which are an example of black box testing technique, as they only check for equality of output variables with predefined parameters.*/
JUnit is a framework for unit testing in Java programming. It allows writing and running automated tests, exception testing, and tracking and analyzing test results. By using JUnit, we can ensure that the code is reliable, bug-free, and meets the requirements of our end users.
We also want to implement the TestFX framework for the GUI, which tests our graphical user interface.

## Test Plan
/*This section outlines the specific testing tasks, timelines, and resources required to achieve the testing objectives.*/
Our JUnit tests currently mainly test the functionalities related to the database. Internally, we have agreed that unit tests will be run before each merge and that they must pass. Resources that we need to achieve the test goals include, for example, csv files that contain data to write to the database.

## Test Cases
This section details the specific test cases that were executed, including their pass/fail status and any defects found during testing. (You may link to the repository of your use cases.)

## Test Results
This section summarizes the results of the testing, including major defects found, their severity, and the steps taken to resolve them. (You may link to the test reports generated by your testing tool.)

## Metrics
This section provides quantitative data on the testing process, such as the number of defects found, the defect resolution time, and the test coverage achieved.

## Recommendations
This section offers suggestions for improving the testing process and the quality of the software.

## Conclusion
This section summarizes the key findings of the testing and the overall status of the software quality.
