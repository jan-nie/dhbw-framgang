## Goal/Focus
The goal of this review meeting was to evaluate the CSV export function and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. The focus was on ensuring the functionality, code quality, performance, security, scalability, and maintainability of the CSV export feature.
We chose the CSV export feature because we concurred that this part of the project needed optimization and all other features were already sufficiently optimized for the live demo.

## Components
### Code quality
**Modularity**:  
The code is divided into logically separated modules or functions to promote reusability.  

**Consistency**:  
The code uses consistent formatting and naming standards to improve readability. However, a method has been implemented twice with identical names. Once without a parameter and once with a parameter. Consistent naming requires that all methods be uniquely named. We have to adapt this accordingly.  

**Testability**:  
The code is structured to be easily testable to facilitate quality assurance.  

**Readability**:  
The code should be well-structured, well-commented, and easy to understand to improve maintainability. We will optimize this as part of the refactoring process.
<br />  
<br />  

### Performance
**Speed**:  
The export function should be efficient and generate CSV files quickly, especially for large amounts of data.  

**Resource Consumption**:  
The export process should optimize resource consumption (CPU, memory) to ensure smooth performance. For this, we use common Java methods that conserve resources.
<br />  
<br />  

### Security
**Privacy**:  
The export function serves only non-sensitive data.  

**Permissions**:  
The export function should ensure that only authorized users have access to the export function and that export operations are performed according to the permissions set. We will implement this in the future.
<br />  
<br />  

### Scalability
**Processing large amounts of data**:  
The export function should be able to handle large amounts of data efficiently without sacrificing performance. The filter function needs to be re-implemented to ensure that only the displayed products and properties are exported.
<br />  
<br />  

### Maintainability
**Modularity**:  
The code is divided into independent modules to allow changes or bug fixes to be made to one module without affecting other parts of the application.  

**Documentation**:  
The code is well documented, including internal comments, to facilitate maintainability and improve understanding.  
<br />  
<br />  

## Review Methodology
As part of the technical review performed, a combination of methods was used to ensure a comprehensive review of the CSV export function.
- As a primary review methodology, we used **code reviews** where experienced developers and team members thoroughly analyzed the code. This approach allowed us to identify potential bugs, inconsistencies in code style, and optimization opportunities. By sharing feedback and discussions within the team, we were able to ensure that the code conformed to overall best practices and standards.  
- In addition, we used **Static Code Analysis** as a supporting methodology. Using a tool, the code was automatically analyzed to identify code smells, security vulnerabilities, and other potential issues. This allowed us to make targeted adjustments and optimizations to improve the quality and security of the code.  
- **User testing** was also conducted to ensure that the CSV export function was intuitive for users and error-free. In this process, selected users tested the function and provided their feedback on the usability, accuracy and efficiency of the export process. The feedback received was carefully analyzed and taken into account in the further development and optimization of the export function.  
<br />  
<br />  

## Outcome
- We need to name the methods uniquely or merge the two methods with the same name.  
- In addition, the class must be optimized as part of the refactoring.  
- Refactor permissions so that the user's permissions are checked and depending on that the export button is displayed or not.  
- For the implementation of the filter function, the code must be restructured so that in the future only those products are exported to which the filter has been applied and which are displayed.  
<br />  
<br />  

### Action Items
For each of these identified aspects, we created action items to be able to optimize the issues until the end of the project. The following is a list of the action items, each of which is assigned to a key point in Outcome.  
- **Consistency**: Jan until 04.06.2023
- **Refactoring**: Nicolai until 04.06.2023
- **Permissions**: Nicolai until 04.06.2023
- **Filter Function**: Marius until 04.06.2023
<br />  
<br />  

### Lessons Learned
In our software project, we identified the following lessons learned:  
Early consideration of scalability is critical to be prepared for unexpected adjustments. For example, an adjustment to the product structure in the database necessitated a restructuring of the code. Comprehensive documentation of the code facilitates further development and maintenance. In addition, conscientious refactoring is important to improve code quality and maintainability. By implementing these insights, we aim to increase the efficiency and quality of our project in the long run.
