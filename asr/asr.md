# Summary of architectural decisions and design patterns for IMSE

## 1. Tactics IMSE will practice
### 1.1 Quality attribute scenarios: Availability

| Source | Stimulus | Artifact | Environment | Response | Response measure |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Software of MongoDB | server unresponsive | Database | internet connection breaks during user input | inform user | within 1 minute |
| Software | server unresponsive | Firewall | normal operation | activate VPN | 20 minutes |

### 1.2 Tactics
- __Detect Faults__: 
To detect errors, we use a ping/echo test. With its help, the database is pinged at regular intervals and an echo is returned if successful. This helps to detect problems with the connection or the database servers. In addition, all operations are documented in a log file. For example, specific error messages are created as part of exception handling and saved in the log.

- __Recover from Faults__:
If the Internet connection is interrupted while the user is entering data, they are stored in a local cache and can be transferred if the connection is stable.

- __Prevent Faults__:
A sanity check is performed with all entries. On the one hand, data types are checked and adjusted if necessary to prevent errors during runtime. On the other hand, the input data is not sent directly to the database but processed using the database interfaces to prevent injections.


### 1.3 Checklist Availability
- Allocation of Responsibilities:<br>
  The database connection needs to be highly available.
  If access to the database is not possible, for whatever reason, the user will be notified.
  If necessary, the user must notify the admin or a technician. In addition, the incident should be noted.
  In the worst case, the system is temporarily unavailable.
- Coordination Model:<br>
	If the connection to the database isnâ€™t possible, the system detects it and handles the problem accordingly.
  The user will be notified and if it is a hardware problem with the database, it should be fixed soon as the database is external.
- Data Model:<br>
	All portions of the system need to be highly available.
  Reasons for errors could be:<br>
  -	Incorrect input which was validated
  -	Network settings of the user's device
  -	Problems in the user's local network
  -	Database connection not possible
- Mapping among Architectural Elements<br>	?
- Reource Management<br>	?
- Binding Time<br>	?
- Choice of Technology:<br>
	Detect/help/recover from faults:
	Event loggers


## 2. Architecture decisions and concrete design patterns IMSE will follow
### 2.1 Architecture decisions
- Backend and frontend are completely separated from each other (communication takes place only via defined interfaces)

### 2.2 Design patterns
- The backend will use the MVC pattern to further segment the functionalities.
